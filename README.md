# Hi there, I'm Rvk (Kenny)! ðŸ‘‹  

## About Me  
ðŸŽ“ **Graduate Student**  
I am a graduate student at the **University of California, Riverside**, Biomedical Sciences program. My ultimate goal is to become a **Clinical Data Analyst** or **Research Data Analyst**, combining my passion for using computational techniques for biomedical research.  

ðŸ–¥ **Technical Skills**  

**MATLAB** â€“ Experienced in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization for neuroscience research.  
**R** â€“ Strong knowledge in data manipulation, statistical tests, and visualization for biostatistics and research applications.  
**Python** â€“ Currently learning Python to expand my data science and machine learning capabilities.  

ðŸ”¬ **Current Research**  
I am currently conducting research in **Dr. Zagha's lab**, where I:  
- Analyze data on **predictive processing** and **selective sensory filtering** in WT and FXS mouse models using **MATLAB**.  
- Develop workflows to preprocess data, perform selective sensory filtering analyses, and create detailed visualizations for publications and presentations.  
- Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to identify patterns in sensory filtering and predictive coding mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of FXS mouse models.  

ðŸŽ® **Interests**  
Outside of research, I enjoy playing gacha games like **Honkai Star Rail**, **Wuthering Waves**, and **Reverse: 1999**.
