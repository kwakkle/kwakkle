# Hi there, I'm Rvk (Kenny)! 👋  

## About Me  
🎓 **Graduate Student**  
I am a graduate student at the **University of California, Riverside**, Biomedical Sciences program. My ultimate goal is to become a **Clinical Data Analyst** or **Research Data Analyst**, combining my passion for using computational techniques for biomedical research.  

🖥 **Technical Skills**  

**MATLAB** – Experienced in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization for neuroscience research.  
**R** – Strong knowledge in data manipulation, statistical tests, and visualization for biostatistics and research applications.  
**Python** – Currently learning Python to expand my data science and machine learning capabilities.  

🔬 **Current Research**  
I am currently conducting research in **Dr. Zagha's lab**, where I:  
- Study **sensory sequence learning** and **cortical dynamics** in wild-type and FMR1 knockout (Fragile X Syndrome) mouse models.
- Use **MATLAB** to preprocess widefield Ca²⁺ imaging data and analyze neural activity across sensory (S1) and frontal (FC) cortices during behavior.
- Apply statistical and **machine learning methods** (e.g., PCA, ANOVA) to compare learning strategies and cortical modulation between genotypes.

🎮 **Interests**  
Outside of research, I enjoy playing gacha games like **Honkai Star Rail**, **Wuthering Waves**, and **Reverse: 1999**.
