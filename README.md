# Hi there, I'm Rvk (Kenny)! 👋  

## About Me  
🎓 **Graduate Student**  
I am a graduate student at the **University of California, Riverside**, Biomedical Sciences program. My ultimate goal is to become a **Clinical Data Analyst** or **Research Data Analyst**, combining my passion for using computational techniques for biomedical research.  

🖥 **Technical Skills**  

**MATLAB** – Experienced in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization for neuroscience research.  
**R** – Strong knowledge in data manipulation, statistical tests, and visualization for biostatistics and research applications.  
**Python** – Currently learning Python to expand my data science and machine learning capabilities.  

🔬 **Current Research**  
I am currently conducting research in **Dr. Zagha's lab**, where I:  
- Study **sensory sequence learning** and **cortical dynamics** in wild-type and FMR1 knockout (Fragile X Syndrome) mouse models.
- Use **MATLAB** to preprocess widefield Ca²⁺ imaging data and analyze neural activity across sensory (S1) and frontal (FC) cortices during behavior.
- Apply statistical and **machine learning methods** (e.g., PCA, ANOVA) to compare learning strategies and cortical modulation between genotypes.

🧪 **Research Highlights**

🧠 Activities of sensory and frontal cortices in sequence learning in Wild Type and FMR1 KO mice

Explored how mice learn sensory sequences using widefield calcium imaging and behavioral modeling. We compared cortical dynamics between wild-type and FMR1 KO mice to study learning differences in a Fragile X Syndrome model.

🎮 **Interests**  
Outside of research, I enjoy playing gacha games like **Honkai Star Rail**, **Wuthering Waves**, and **Reverse: 1999**.
